# Approach & Efficiency

* create method name is HashmapRepeatedWord

* declare dictionary

* take a string as parameter , split string by { ' ', ',', '.', ':' , '\t' }

* loop through this array

* if array contains word increment count else add it to dictionary

* loop to Find first repeated word.

# Big O represents the complexity of a function that increases linearly and in direct proportion to the number of inputs.

### Time Complexity: O(n) 

### Space Complexity: O(1)
